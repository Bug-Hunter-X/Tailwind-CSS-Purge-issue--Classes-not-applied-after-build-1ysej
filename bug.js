```javascript
// Some Tailwind classes are not applied on the component after build
/*The issue is related to the Tailwind's purge setting. The purge setting removes unused CSS classes, and if the component is not rendered on the initial page load, its classes might be purged.
To solve this, you need to make sure that the component is rendered even on the initial load or adjust your purge settings to allow the specific classes.
